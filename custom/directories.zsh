#  CDABLE_VARS (-T): If the argument to a cd command (or an implied cd with the AUTO_CD option set) is not a directory, and does not begin with a slash, try to expand the expression as if it were preceded by a `~' (see the section `Filename Expansion').

#   CHASE_LINKS (-w): Resolve symbolic links to their true values when changing directory.  This also has the effect of CHASE_DOTS, i.e. a `..' path segment will be treated as referring to the physical parent, even if the preceding path seg‚Äê ment is a symbolic link.
